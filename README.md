# Operating-Systems
Repository for Operating Systems
An operating systems main job is to be an interface between the end user (me) and the hardware. 
Operating systems will vary so if we look at the Linux system, they are an open source system that allows Google (AKA android to everyone else ) to have a somewhat prebuilt OS that they can then customize for their themselves and their users without going from the ground up. 
It’s like a company that you may use to provide a shell of a webpage which gives you the basics that you then customize for yourself.

Another function of the operating system in this case Linux is to handle the desktop environment. This is where the users start to get involved.
Most of us are familiar with the desktop as that is our “Home zone” but not many of us know (myself included) would know that Linux is what controls this versus android 
or as I like to call it Google. This is where they have built in applications, web browsers, games, etc.

One of my favorite functions of Operating Systems is the applications. If we have the “Shell” the desktop its not a lot of fun. 
It would be like looking at a blanket that we cannot touch, feel, or even sleep in. 
Linux has a app store that houses their applications which for the engineers using the OS they can search what they want to install which inevitably is what the user sees/has loaded when they get their brand new out of the box device.
